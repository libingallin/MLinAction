    "\n",
    "The **[odds ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio)** is one way of expressing probability. You've undoubtedly heared someone say that a (favorite) team's chance of winning is 3 to 1. **Odds** are the probability of success (for example, winning) divided by the probability of failure (losing). Mathematically, this can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Odds(A) = P(A) / P(~A) = The\\  probability\\ of\\ A\\ divided\\ by\\ the\\ probability\\ of\\ not\\ A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So 3-to-1 odds is equivalent to $0.75/0.25=3$ and $log(3)=0.47712$\n",
    "\n",
    "If A were a fair coin toss(硬币), the odds of heads would be $0.5 / 0.5 = 1$, $log(1) =0$. It turns out that the $log(Odds)$ can take on any real-valued number. A log odds value near $-\\infty$ denotes a highly unlikely event(不可能事件). A value near $+\\infty$ indicates near certainty(确定发生), and $log(1) = 0$ indicates an even random change(随机事件). \n",
    "\n",
    "Using log-odds instead of regular probability is a mathematical trick(数学技巧) that makes certain computation easier, because unlike probabilities, they're not limited to values between 0 and 1.\n",

    "+ **Tuning the model parameters(调整模型参数)** -- ML algorithms are configured with parameters specific to the underlying algorithm, and the optimal values of these parameters often depends on the type and structure of the data. The value of each parameter, or any of them combined, can have an impact on the performance of the model. 机器学习算法是由特定于底层算法的参数进行配置的，这些参数的优化与数据的类型和结构有关。每个参数的值，或它们任意组合都会影响模型的性能。\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Selecting a subset of features(特征子集的选取)** -- Many ML problems include a large number of features, and the noise from those features can sometimes make it hard for the algorithm to find the real signal in the data, even though they might still be informative on their own. For many ML problems, having a lot of data is a good thing; but it can sometimes be a curse. And because u don't know before hand when this will affect your model performance, u have to carefully determine the features that make up the most general and accurate model. 许多ML问题包含大量的特征，并且这些特征的噪声有时使得算法很难发现数据的真实信息，即使这些特征本身是非常有用的。数据量大是一件好事，但有时会起反作用。因为事先不可能知道噪声何时会影响模型的性能，所以在确定大多数通用且精确模型的特征时，一定要谨慎。\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Preprocessing the data(数据预处理)** -- Most real-world datasets aren't in a clean state, and u will have perform cleaning and processing, a process widely referred to as **data munging** or **data wrangling**. The dataset may include names that are spelled differently, although they refer to the same entity, or having missing or incorrect values, and these things can hurt the performance of the model. It may sound like edge cases, but u'll be surprised how often this happens even in sophisticated, data-driven organizations. 实际上数据集不会很单纯，必须进行数据清洗和处理，这个过程被广泛称为数据改写或数据打磨。数据集中可能包含同物异名，缺失或不正确的值，这些都会影响模型的性能。这听起来像边缘情况，但在复杂的数据驱动的组织中，时常发生。\n",
